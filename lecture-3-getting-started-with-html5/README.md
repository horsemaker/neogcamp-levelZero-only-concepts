# **Getting started with HTML5**
In this document, along with the concepts, we will also address some keywords used in HTML.
## Introduction to HTML5
### [**HTML**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) stands for **HyperText Markup Language**. It allows the modification and adjustments of the appearance of  web pages. It is responsible for layout the structure of the web page.

- Here, **HyperText** means a text which contains links to other texts and **Markup Language** is a computer language that uses tags to define elements within a document.

***HTML and CSS are not programming, they are more about using high level tokens used to show that how the page should look like***

## Semantic HTML
- In programming, **Semantic** refers to the *meaning* of the code. It tells that what is the purpose of this piece of code 
    -  Eg. `<h1>` tag is used to write the main heading of the webpage
	So the data written within this tag then it is understood that it is the main title.
- But in case of `<div>`, it is used wrap flow content. It has no effect on the content. It is a **non-Semantic** tag.


## HTML **`<head>` tag** vs **`<body>` tag**
- In `<head>` tag we mention the code which is not to be displayed on the web page. It includes information about the page, **metadata** (data about data) and how to process it. It is the first section of the HTML document
- In `<body` tag we mention the contents which is to be displayed on the page, the **actual content**. It is the second section of the HTML document
