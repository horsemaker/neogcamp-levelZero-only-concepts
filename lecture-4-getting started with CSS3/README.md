# ***Getting started with CSS3***

# ABOUT CSS3
- Cascading style sheet is something that helps an html page look better and attractive, basically designing web pages.
- It works in conjunction with HTML to provide a nice look, style, and structure to the program. The latest version of CSS is CSS3.

# WAYS TO INCLUDE CSS
>External css

- Make a separate  .css file and then link it to the html file.
>Internal css

- Inside the head tag of the html file, create a style tag and write down the css properties and put an end tag of style.
>Inline css

- Inside a tag to which the property has to be applied.


# WHICH WAY IS THE IDEAL ONE?
External css is the best practice to be followed, as it makes changing and accessing the css property easy and also allows reusability.
# SELECTORS IN CSS
- CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.
- We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:
1. Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
2. Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
3. Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
4. Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
5. Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
 
 
- Group selector:
To group selectors, separate each selector with a comma.

# CSS INSPECT ELEMENTS 
Where is the inspect?
When you right-click on any web page, there is an inspect option

It gives all the info about any element on the page., (if we find anything really good and useful for our project work, we can just inspect and grab that piece of code)

It also helps to debug the code.

# COMMENTS IN CSS
Comments are used to explain the code, and may help when you edit the source code at a later date.
