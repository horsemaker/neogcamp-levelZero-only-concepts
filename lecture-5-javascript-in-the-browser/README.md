# JavaScript in the Browser
## Introduction
### History
- Due to browser inconsistency, people started using jQuery everywhere for even simpler programs and it provided a common interface to every browser. Few well-known companies then wanted to follow a common standard. They formed a group and decided to create a standard which will work on all browsers.Thus, JavaScript ( earlier known as mocha ) was created.
- Now, JavaScript works on almost all modern browsers

### JavaScript 
- JavaScript is a text-based dynamic programming language which can be used on both client-side and server-side. It can change the HTML and CSS of a webpage and also can calculate, manipulate and validate the data fetched from the webpage or from any source.
- It is written within the script tag.

### VanillaJS 
- VanillaJS is the purest form of JavaScript where no additional frameworks or libraries are used.


### Emmet 
- Emmet is a free add-on for your text editor that allows you to type shortcuts that are then expanded into full pieces of code.

### External vs Internal JS file
- If the Javascript code  is to be executed first or along with the HTML code then the js code is preferred to be written within script tag in the head tag
- Else, if two or more HTML files require same set of JS code, then it is preferred to create separate JS file and link the HTML pages via ‘src’ attribute
